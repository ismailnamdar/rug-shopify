Kids can work independently because of the fully-illustrated recipe guides, or families can use the time to come and work together in the kitchen. No time in the schedule to make all of the recipes? No problem — take on one recipe each week and spread out the kit’s contents. If you’re hosting guests or have a special occasion, set aside some time and you can complete the kit all at once. There’s no right or wrong way to approach using Raddish Kids, just the way that works best for your family!</p><p>Even kids who are self-described “picky eaters” find joy in Raddish — founder Samantha Barnes knows that “kids who cook, eat!”, and created Raddish because she wanted every child to have the chance to discover new flavors and foods through the wonder of cooking. Science shows that it can take 15 different exposures to a food before a child will try it, and Raddish helps along the way as kids get excited when they’re part of making ingredients transform into completed dishes.</p>",
